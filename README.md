# html-email-template
An html email template that degrades gracefully across email applications

There are several different email readers out there. Some are very good at displaying rich email and some are not.
This email template is built in HTML and degrades nicely across different email applications. The secret to this template is the media querys and old style tables that trigger image swapping and reflowing of text when the email application window changes dimension.

The template is commented out to indicate sections of the email template.
The base images are all included in the Links folder so you can just edit them in an image editing program like photoshop or GIMP.

With this template you can develope a very basic email newsletter or campaign message just by swapping out images and retyping the copy in each section.
